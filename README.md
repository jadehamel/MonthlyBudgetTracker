# Monthly Budget Tracker

## Description

The Monthly Budget Tracker is a web-based application that helps users keep track of their monthly spending. Starting with a budget of $4000.00, the application displays a dynamically updating countdown that shows the remaining amount for the month, considering the current date and time. This allows users to see how much money is still available to spend for the rest of the month.

## Features

- **Dynamic Countdown**: The remaining budget is updated every second.
- **Monthly Reset**: The countdown resets at the beginning of each month.
- **Current Date Display**: The application shows the current month, day, and year.
- **Variable Month Lengths**: The application accounts for the different number of days in each month.
